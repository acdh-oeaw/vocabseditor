                   The purpose of ACDH Vocabularies Editor is to provide a service for <b>collaborative work on controlled vocabularies</b> development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The editor follows <b>SKOS</b> data model for the main elements of a controlled vocabulary.
                    <b>Dublin core</b> schema is used to capture the metadata (such as date created, date modified, creator, contributor, source and other) about each element.
                    Each Concept Scheme can be downloaded in <b>RDF/XML</b> and <b>Turtle</b> formats as well as each individual Concept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>user management</b> system allows a user to share a created Concept Scheme with other users (called 'curators') to create new, edit and delete Concepts and Collections within this Concept Scheme.
                    Each user can find a summary of her/his latest activity  on user's page.
